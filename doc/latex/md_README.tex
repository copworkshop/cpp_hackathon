Your team was assigned to maintain a legacy application, written and forgotten long time ago. The application helps florist shop to maintain their stock, control prices and define policies of how the value of the stock changes over time. You were told that application was poorly maintained, so you were given some time to make yourself comfortable with it. The plan is to modernize it and expand its functionalities, so make sure you spend the initial preparation time effectively.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Pre-\/requisite\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsection{1. High level overview and documentation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md10}
a. Problem\+: You already see that the previous team did not leave any documentation behind them. Make sure you understand on a high level what the application does, and you have appropriate code documentation available. b. Success Criteria\+: You are able to automatically publish Github pages using Github actions that will consist of high-\/level documentation of the application, automatically generated documentation (sphinx? Doxygen?). \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsubsection{2. Unit Testing}\label{md_README_autotoc_md11}
a. Problem\+: Once you understand how the application works, it would be good to see it works. Make sure you have proper code coverage. b. Success Criteria\+: i. You are able to compile and run unit tests both locally and through Github actions. ii. You are able to measure code coverage and report it through Github actions. Pick reasonable code coverage benchmark and fail builds if coverage goes below that (we suggest 75\%) \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsubsection{3. Refactoring}\label{md_README_autotoc_md12}
a. Problem\+: You have already noticed that some parts of the current application are too complicated. Since the code will be here for a while, you decide that it is a good moment for refactoring. b. Success Criteria\+: You are able to measure cyclomatic complexity of the application through github actions. You have refactored the most complex parts of the system without regression and dropped the complexity to an acceptable number. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsubsection{4. Database connection}\label{md_README_autotoc_md13}
a. Problem\+: Currently the application uses files to store data. You want to migrate the application to use the cloud database. b. Success Criteria\+: i. Application reads db configuration from a configuration file ii. Application can either use file (start with an argument /infile $<$filename$>$) or database (start with an argument /db $<$db\+\_\+configuration.\+filename$>$) iii. Application kept an ability to produce an output file in json form (invoked argument /outfile filename). If an application was started with /db parameter and /outfile parameters, it outputs both to database and to a file. iv. Application can read and store data in the database v. Application connects to the database securely and with authentication\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsubsection{5. REST API}\label{md_README_autotoc_md14}
a. Problem\+: Current app must be run manually at the end of business day, so that the information is updated appropriately. The customer wants to integrate the business logic with external services through API so that both reads and updates can be performed on demand. b. Success Criteria\+: i. You have set up an HTTP server that will be able to serve appropriate endpoints\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item /stock – Outputs existing stock data in JSON format
\item /update (POST) – performs an update action of the current stock ii. You have integrated the existing application with the webserver Note\+: The preferred approach would be to set up a webserver in a language, that can use the C++ modules directly. We strongly suggest Python for server and direct calls to business logic of what you initially saw as an Update\+Quality() method. iii. You have covered the solution with unit tests
