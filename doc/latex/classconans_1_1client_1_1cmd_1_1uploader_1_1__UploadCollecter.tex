\begin{DoxyVerb}Collect all the packages in the local cache to be uploaded:
- Collect the refs that matches the given pattern _collect_refs_to_upload
- Collect for every ref all the binaries IDs that has to be uploaded
  "_collect_packages_to_upload". This may discard binaries that do not
  belong to the current RREV
The collection of this does the interactivity (ask user if yes/no),
the errors (don't upload packages with policy=build_always, and computing
the full REVISIONS for every that has to be uploaded.
No remote API calls are done in this step, everything is local
