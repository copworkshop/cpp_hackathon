\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}    pygments.styles.tango
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Crunchy default Style inspired from the color palette from
    the Tango Icon Theme Guidelines.

    http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines

    Butter:     #fce94f     #edd400     #c4a000
    Orange:     #fcaf3e     #f57900     #ce5c00
    Chocolate:  #e9b96e     #c17d11     #8f5902
    Chameleon:  #8ae234     #73d216     #4e9a06
    Sky Blue:   #729fcf     #3465a4     #204a87
    Plum:       #ad7fa8     #75507b     #5c35cc
    Scarlet Red:#ef2929     #cc0000     #a40000
    Aluminium:  #eeeeec     #d3d7cf     #babdb6
                #888a85     #555753     #2e3436

    Not all of the above colors are used; other colors added:
        very light grey: #f8f8f8  (for background)

    This style can be used as a template as it includes all the known
    Token types, unlike most (if not all) of the styles included in the
    Pygments distribution.

    However, since Crunchy is intended to be used by beginners, we have strived
    to create a style that gloss over subtle distinctions between different
    categories.

    Taking Python for example, comments (Comment.*) and docstrings (String.Doc)
    have been chosen to have the same style.  Similarly, keywords (Keyword.*),
    and Operator.Word (and, or, in) have been assigned the same style.
