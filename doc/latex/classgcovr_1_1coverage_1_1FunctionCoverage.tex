\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Represent coverage information about a function.

The counter is stored as dictionary with the line as key to be able
to merge function coverage in different ways

Args:
    name (str):
        The name (signature) of the functions.
    lineno (int):
        The line number.
    count (int):
        How often this function was executed.
    returned (int):
        How often this function returned.
    blocks (float):
        Block coverage of function.
    excluded (bool, optional):
        Whether this line is excluded by a marker.
